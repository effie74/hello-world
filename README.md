# hello-world
my first repository

i am an artist and graphic designer, who owns a website. i paid a big amount of money to turn it into dynamic last year and the result was to get a website that i cannot have controll over my pages... i cannot afford any other money for maintenance and further development, so i decided to take back control by learning anything that can help me further develop my site.
